# This file ensures the uploads directory is tracked by Git
# while actual uploaded files are ignored by .gitignore

# The uploads directory is used for storing patient documents,
# images, and other files uploaded through the WeCare PWA system.

# Directory structure will be organized as:
# uploads/
# ├── documents/        # Patient documents (PDFs, images)
# ├── avatars/         # User profile pictures
# ├── temp/            # Temporary upload staging area
# └── archives/        # Archived or historical files

# Security notes:
# - Files are stored outside the web root for security
# - Access controlled through API endpoints with authentication
# - File paths are stored in database, not directly accessible
# - Virus scanning should be implemented before storage (Phase 5)

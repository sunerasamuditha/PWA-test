<!-- 
PWA Icon Files Placeholder

The following icon files should be added to this directory for the PWA to function properly:

1. icon-192x192.png - 192x192 pixel icon for Android and general PWA use
2. icon-512x512.png - 512x512 pixel icon for Android and general PWA use  
3. apple-touch-icon.png - 180x180 pixel icon for iOS devices
4. favicon.ico - Standard favicon for browsers

All icons should feature the WeCare branding and logo.

Design Guidelines:
- Use the WeCare primary color (#2563eb) as the dominant color
- Include the WeCare logo or medical cross symbol
- Ensure good contrast and visibility at small sizes
- Follow PWA icon best practices for rounded corners and safe areas

These icons are referenced in:
- client/index.html (apple-touch-icon and manifest)
- client/vite.config.js (PWA manifest configuration)
